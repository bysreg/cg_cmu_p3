I implemented these functions :
- raytracer
- intersection tests for sphere, model, and triangle
- properly handle arbitrary scaling and rotation, and translation geometries
- eye rays
- direct illumination and shadows
- specular reflections
- refractions
- colors computation
- soft shadows
- correctly render the scenes in the scenes directory
- for the fresnel effect, there is an option to only select one out of two rays, relection or refraction, to trace. namely, USE_RAND preprocessor. 

I also implemented these extra marks : 
- depth of field
- glossy reflections

how to turn on depth of field : -f <apperture_size> <focal_length> => example : ./p3 scenes/cube.scene -f 0.4 12
how to turn on glossy reflections : -g <glossy_surface_width>

the major part of the code's implementation are located in raytracer.cpp, Geometry class and all the Geometry child's classes.
